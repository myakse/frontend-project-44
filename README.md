# Project Description:
**"Brain Games"** It is a five console games for brain training: "Brain even", "Brain calculator", "Brain gcd", "Brain progression", "Brain prime". 

Each game presents questions that need to be answered correctly. The game ends when three correct answers are given. If the player gives an incorrect answer, the game ends and prompts the user to play it again.

# Installation instructions:
1. Clone the repository locally
`git clone git@github.com:myakse/frontend-project-44.git`
2. Go to the created directory
`cd frontend-project-44.git`
3. Install Dependencies
`make install`

# Instructions for use:
1. **Brain even** - the user needs to determine whether the proposed number is even or odd.

To start the game enter `brain-even`

2. **Калькулятор** - the user needs to calculate a mathematical expression.

To start the game enter `brain-calc`

3. **Brain gcd** - the user needs to calculate the greatest common divisor of the two given numbers.

To start the game enter `brain-gcd`

4. **Brain progression** - the user needs to determine the hidden number of the arithmetic progression.

To start the game enter `brain-progression`

5. **Brain prime** - the user needs to determine if the proposed number is prime.

To start the game enter `brain-prime`
